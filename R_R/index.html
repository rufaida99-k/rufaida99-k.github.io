    <h3>Hi there!</h3>

<main>
      <p> Hey there! My name is Rufaida, though most people call me Rufi. I'm a senior at New York University, double majoring in Politics and Computer Science. I am also an International Transfer from India, formerly a student at the University of Delhi, where I studied Political Science. <br>
        It is my opinion that politics is pervasive, and present in everything we observe around us - even technology. I am interested in inculcating technological social responsibility within my Computer Science education, and contribute to the tech sector with these skills. I also love to paint, bake, sing and have recently tried my hand at film photography.

      <p> Over the past couple semesters, I have worked on multiple projects, however there are a few that are very close to my heart, and these are: <br>
<br>
      Cherry Blossoms in NYC: I was fascinated by the beautiful pink sakura trees, and wanted to know more about where they came from. <br>
<br>
      The Polaroid Diaries: Once I organized the pictures I'd clicked, I saw a few themes materializing and made this page. <br>
<br>
      Course Registration System: This project is a simplified version of a typical University registration system that students have to navigate each semester. <br>
<br>
      BattleShip Game: I was very excited to code this because I had never played Battleship before, but towards the end of the project I got very good at it! <br>
<br>
      Publication - The Awkward Bourgeois: I worked on this article in an effort to address the political climate in India.  <br>
