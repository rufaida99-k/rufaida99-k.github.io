		<h3>Hi there!</h3>
		<main>
			<p> When I was a child, and had to colour in trees or leaves, I would pick pink as my colour of choice and draw pink trees. 
				I did not really know that "pink" trees existed, I just assumed they did not because the idea seemed too good to be true. 
				Of course, when I grew up, I realised that they really did exist, just not in my country. <br>
				I did as much research as I could on an extremely slow computer, to figure out where these magical trees grew. 
				The answer was China (eventually also found its way to Japan during the Tang dynasty) so I immediately gave up on the idea of ever seeing them in person because if it was not in my neighbourhood, the chances were slim to none. 
				When I got into NYU, and saw that Washington Square Park had cherry blossom trees - I was over the moon, because the younger version of me would've probably passed out had she known she would see them one day. <br>

			<p> I researched a bit more on how these cherry blossoms even got to NYC, because to my knowledge, they are not native to the US. 
				<br>
				I found out that they were in fact a gift from Japan to the US in 1909. This was a historical moment. 
				<br></br>
				The Committee of Japanese Residents of NY, as part of the Hudson-Fulton 18-day celebration, which commemorated the 100th anniversary of Robert Fulton's steam-powered boat on the Hudson River, and also the 300th anniversary of Henry Hudson's discovery and exploration of that river, were to present cherry trees to mark the occasion. 
				<br>
				However, that shipment of seeds from Japan was lost at sea, and it wasn't until 1912 that another shipment was received. 
				Now, this new shipment of cherry tree seeds was planted in (then) Clairmont Park, which was re-named "Sakura" Park, to honour their Japanese origin, on the 28th of April, 1912. 
				<br></br>
				We celebrate this anniversary as the widely known Cherry Blossom Festival every year since.
