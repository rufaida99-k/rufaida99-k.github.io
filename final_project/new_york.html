				I'd seen the Statue of Liberty many times, but never this close. I was on a cruise and we stayed in front of the Statue for 10-15 minutes, so we could appreciate the scale of it. It was freezing cold, and the biting wind was not helping, but we couldn't help but stare and take in the moment.

				Walking around Central Park has become a routine for me, but I will never forget this day. I must've walked half the length of Central Park with a friend, and we spotted this gorgeous bird standing near a cherry blossom tree. It didn't say much, and neither did we.

				Watching the skyline up-close was an exhilerating experience, and I really do not think I could forget it. I do love the New York skyline in the morning, but the glittering buildings have an entirely different story to tell come nightfall. I hope I can see it again (soon!).
