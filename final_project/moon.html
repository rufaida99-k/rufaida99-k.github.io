				I clicked this picture on the 23rd of July 2020. I still remember how nervous I was trying to get the blur and exposure effect right.

				This picture was clicked soon after the first one, on the 25th of July 2020. This was during the lockdown, and the skies had never been this clear in a long time, which is why we were able to see so many vibrant colours during sunrise and sunset. It became a ritual for me to be wake up at sunrise, and watch the sky illuminate. <br>

				Clicked on the 19th of November 2021, this picture captured the Partial Lunar Eclipse in the New York Sky, and it lasted one day. <br>
				I had seen a lunar eclipse before, but never this clear. It was absolutely stunning. <br>
