				Here, There Are Blueberries (By Mary Szybist) 
				<br>
				When I see the bright clouds, a sky empty of moon and stars, <br>
				I wonder what I am, that anyone should note me. <br>
				<br>
				Here there are blueberries, what should I fear? <br>
				Here there is bread in thick slices, of whom should I be afraid? <br>
				<br>
				Under the swelling clouds, we spread our blankets. <br>
				Here in this meadow, we open our baskets <br>
				to unpack blueberries, whole bowls of them, <br>
				berries not by the work of our hands, <br>
				berries not by the work of our fingers <br>
				<br>
				What taste the bright world has, whole fields <br>
				without wires, the blackened moss, the clouds <br>
				swelling at the edges of the meadow. And for this, <br>
				I did nothing, not even wonder. <br>
				<br>
				You must live for something, they say <br>
				People don't live just to keep on living. <br>
				<br>
				But here is a quince tree, a sky bright and empty. <br>
				Here there are blueberries, there is no need to note me. <br>
				<br>

				Oranges (By Ritika Jyala, excerpt from The Flesh I Burned) <br>
				As a child, I was always searching <br>
				for the meaning of it all, the big Why; <br>
				and my father always said that <br>
				there is no one big purpose <br>
				but I had the most ripe orange today <br>
				and kissed my cat goodnight, <br>
				I think that's enough purpose for a day. <br>

				Ode To Cherries (By <a href="https://symonr9.tumblr.com/post/177603194186/ode-to-cherries">Simon</a>) <br>
				red happiness <br>
				plump with velvet joy yet valiant  <br>
				the virtuous knight  <br>
				young as the morning dawn yet lossless to the night  <br>
				this cherry is a fruit of merciless  <br>
				combat <br>
				in the fields of battle <br>
				but soft love songs in the streets of his hometown  <br>
				ladies, they swoon <br>
				water gushes from the river <br>
				this cherry is a romance <br>
				red comrade <br>
				crimson province <br>
				humble yet brave <br>
				war-tested yet beautiful <br>
				this cherry <br>
				the summer's champion <br>
